The jars in this package are NOT directly runnable.
In order to run the jars, you have to add the jars in the dependency folder to your classpath and define the main class.
These jars are mainly intended for integration in your projects if you are not able to use maven.

Runnable fatjars with built-in dependencies ("jar-with-depenencies.jar") can be found on Maven Central under:
